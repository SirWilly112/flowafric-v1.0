    question: "What is FlowAfric?",
    answer: "FlowAfric is a comprehensive super app designed specifically for Africans. It combines multiple financial services including Naira and cryptocurrency wallets, P2P trading (FlowConnect), marketplace shopping (FlowHub), VoIP calling, and payment processing - all in one secure platform."
  },
  {
    question: "How secure is my money with FlowAfric?",
    answer: "FlowAfric employs bank-grade security measures including multi-layer encryption, secure multi-signature wallets, regular security audits, and compliance with international financial regulations. Your funds are protected with the highest security standards, and we maintain 99.95% uptime for reliability."
  },
  {
    question: "How does FlowConnect P2P trading work?",
    answer: "FlowConnect uses an innovative maker-taker model. Makers set their own exchange rates and terms, while Takers can instantly execute trades at posted rates. This enables competitive pricing and instant balance transfers between verified users, making P2P trading faster and more efficient than traditional methods."
  },
  {
    question: "What is FlowHub escrow and how much does it cost?",
    answer: "FlowHub escrow is an optional service that protects both buyers and sellers in marketplace transactions. For just 1% of the transaction value, escrow holds the buyer's funds until goods are delivered and verified. This ensures secure transactions and builds trust between parties. Escrow is optional - you can choose when to use it."
  },
  {
    question: "How much are FlowAfric's merchant fees?",
    answer: "FlowAfric charges only 1% for merchant payment processing - one of the lowest rates in Africa. This competitive fee structure helps merchants save money and offer better prices to customers while still maintaining world-class payment processing infrastructure."
  },

  },
  {
